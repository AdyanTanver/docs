## Overview

Webhooks provide real-time notifications about important events in your screening process. Instead of requiring you to continuously poll our API for updates, webhooks push notifications directly to your specified endpoint whenever there's a change in status or new information becomes available.

## Getting Started

### 1. Register Your Webhook Endpoint

To start receiving webhook notifications, please provide your webhook endpoint URL to: `concierge@cove.co`

Your endpoint should be:

- Publicly accessible over HTTPS
- Capable of handling POST requests
- Able to respond with a 2xx status code

### 2. Security

All webhook requests will:

- Be sent over HTTPS
- Include a signature header for verification
- Contain a unique webhook ID
- Include a timestamp of when the event occurred

## Event Types

Our webhooks notify you about the following screening status changes:

### Screening Status Updates

- `screening.started`: A new screening process has begun
- `screening.updated`: New information has been added to the screening
- `screening.completed`: The screening process has been completed
- `screening.error`: An error occurred during the screening process

### Verification Updates

- `verification.employment`: Employment verification status changes
- `verification.assets`: Asset verification status changes
- `verification.residence`: Residence history verification changes
- `verification.bank`: Bank connection status changes

## Webhook Payload

Each webhook notification includes a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": "whk_123456789",
    "event": "screening.updated",
    "created": "2025-02-03T12:04:23-05:00",
    "data": {
        "screening_id": "scr_987654321",
        "status": "in_progress",
        "verification_type": "employment",
        "completion_percentage": 75,
        "updated_fields": ["employment_status", "income_verification"],
        "metadata": {
            "applicant_id": "app_123456",
            "property_id": "prop_789012"
        }
    }
}
```

### Payload Fields

- `id`: Unique identifier for the webhook notification
- `event`: The type of event that triggered the webhook
- `created`: Timestamp when the event occurred
- `data`: Object containing event-specific information
  - `screening_id`: ID of the associated screening
  - `status`: Current status of the screening
  - `verification_type`: Type of verification being updated (if applicable)
  - `completion_percentage`: Overall completion percentage
  - `updated_fields`: Array of fields that were updated
  - `metadata`: Additional context about the screening

## Best Practices

1. **Acknowledge Quickly**: Return a 2xx response as soon as you receive the webhook. Process the data asynchronously if needed.

2. **Implement Retry Logic**: Your endpoint should be able to handle duplicate events. Use the webhook `id` to prevent double-processing.

3. **Monitor Failures**: If we receive consecutive failed delivery attempts, we'll notify the email address on file.

4. **Store Raw Payload**: Save the raw webhook data before processing it, in case you need to debug issues later.

## Testing

You can use our test environment to simulate webhook events and verify your integration. Contact our support team at <concierge@cove.co> to enable test mode for your webhook endpoint.
