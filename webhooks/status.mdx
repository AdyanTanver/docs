The `status` field in webhook notifications indicates the current state of an applicant's screening. This document details all possible status values and their meanings.

## Status Values

### SENT

Initial state when a screening request is created and sent to the applicant. You'll receive this status when a new screening is initiated.

### IN_PROGRESS

The applicant has begun the screening process. This status indicates they are actively working through the verification steps.

### USER_COMPLETED

The applicant has finished submitting all required information. The system is now processing their submissions through various verification services.

### COMPLETE

All verification processes have finished. The screening results are ready for review and decision-making.

### ACCEPTED

A positive decision has been made on the screening. The applicant has been approved.

### REJECTED

A negative decision has been made on the screening. The applicant has not been approved.

## Typical Flow

A screening progresses through these states sequentially:

```txt
SENT → IN_PROGRESS → USER_COMPLETED → COMPLETE → (ACCEPTED or REJECTED)
```
