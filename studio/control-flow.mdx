## Overview
The `control_flow` object in our platform defines how each step in the verification process transitions based on specific conditions. It enables dynamic decision-making by supporting conditional logic, allowing the flow to branch based on predefined criteria. If `control_flow` is not provided for a step, the process will run sequentially to the next step.

## Structure of `control_flow`
Each step contains a `control_flow` object with the following fields:

### 1. `condition`
Defines the logic for evaluating a decision. The condition consists of:
- `condition_operator`: The operator used to compare values (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`).
- `condition_field`: The data field being evaluated.
- `condition_value`: The expected value used for comparison.

### 2. `if_goto`
Specifies the next step to transition to if the condition evaluates to `true`.

### 3. `else_goto` (Optional)
Specifies the next step to transition to if the condition evaluates to `false`.

### 4. `end` (Optional)
If set to `true`, it indicates that the process terminates at this step if reached.

## Execution Flow
- If a step has a `control_flow`, the conditions determine the next step.
- If a step does not have a `control_flow`, the process continues sequentially to the next step in the list.

## Example `control_flow` Objects

### Example 1: ID Verification
```json
"control_flow": {
    "condition": {
        "condition_operator": "==",
        "condition_field": "id_valid",
        "condition_value": true
    },
    "if_goto": "6797dfe7a4c4910bc0f1d492",
    "else_goto": "6797dfe7a4c4910bc0f1d434"
}
```
- If `id_valid` is `true`, the process moves to `BACKGROUND_CHECK`.
- Otherwise, it moves to `manual_review`.

### Example 2: Credit Report
```json
"control_flow": {
    "condition": {
        "condition_operator": ">=",
        "condition_field": "credit_score",
        "condition_value": 700
    },
    "if_goto": "6797fe5e683fb1e8abe7d853",
    "else_goto": "6797fe5e683fb1e8abe7d882"
}
```
- If `credit_score` is `700` or above, the process continues to `BANK_CONNECT`.
- Otherwise, it moves to `request_credit_report_again`.

### Example 3: Process Completion
```json
"control_flow": {
    "end": true
}
```
- This step marks the end of the process.
