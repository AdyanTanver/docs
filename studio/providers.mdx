# Providers in Cove

## Overview
The `provider` object in Cove defines the external or internal service responsible for handling each verification step. Some steps may also include a `fallback_provider` to ensure redundancy if the primary provider fails.

## Structure of `provider`
Each step may contain a `provider` object with the following fields:

### 1. `name`
The primary service provider used for this step. Examples include:
- `Persona` for ID verification and background checks.
- `Equifax` for employment and credit reports.
- `Plaid` for banking data connections.
- `DocuSign` for document processing.

### 2. `fallback_provider` (Optional)
Some steps may have a secondary provider to ensure completion in case the primary provider is unavailable. For example:
- `Equifax` uses `TransUnion` as a fallback for credit reports.
- `Plaid` uses `Flinks` as a fallback for bank connections.

## Example `provider` Objects

### Example 1: ID Verification
```json
"provider": {
    "name": "Persona"
}
```
- The `Persona` service is responsible for ID verification.

### Example 2: Credit Report with Fallback
```json
"provider": {
    "name": "Equifax",
    "fallback": "TransUnion"
}
```
- The primary credit report provider is `Equifax`, but if unavailable, `TransUnion` will be used.

### Example 3: Bank Connection with Fallback
```json
"provider": {
    "name": "Plaid",
    "fallback": "Flinks"
}
```
- The primary provider for banking connections is `Plaid`, with `Flinks` as a backup.
