# Providers in Cove

## Overview
The `provider` field in Cove specifies which verification services are available for each step. When multiple providers are specified, they act as fallbacks in order - if the first provider fails, Cove will try the next one, and so on until a successful verification is achieved.

## Provider Configuration
In your flow configuration, providers are specified as an array of strings, where each subsequent provider serves as a fallback:

```json
"provider": ["Persona"]  // Single provider, no fallback
"provider": ["Atomic", "Argyle"]  // Atomic primary, Argyle as fallback
"provider": []  // No external provider (internal verification)
```

## Available Providers by Step

### ID Verification
```json
{
    "name": "ID_VERIFICATION",
    "provider": ["Persona"]
}
```
Persona is the primary provider for identity verification. No fallback provider is available.

### Employment Verification
```json
{
    "name": "EMPLOYMENT",
    "provider": ["Atomic", "Argyle"]
}
```
Atomic is the primary provider for employment verification. If Atomic fails, Cove will automatically attempt verification through Argyle.

### Bank Connection
```json
{
    "name": "BANK_CONNECT",
    "provider": ["Plaid", "Flinks"]
}
```
Plaid is the primary provider for bank connections. If Plaid connection fails, Cove will automatically fall back to Flinks.

### Personal Information
```json
{
    "name": "PERSONAL_INFO",
    "provider": []
}
```
Personal information collection is handled internally by Cove with no external providers.

### Residence History
```json
{
    "name": "RESIDENCE_HISTORY",
    "provider": []
}
```
Residence history verification is managed internally by Cove with no external providers.

### Personal Assets
```json
{
    "name": "PERSONAL_ASSETS",
    "provider": []
}
```
Asset verification is handled internally by Cove with no external providers.

## Provider Capabilities

| Provider | Primary Use | Capabilities |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Persona  | Identity Verification | Document verification, Selfie matching, Liveness detection, Background checks |
| Atomic   | Employment Primary | Employment verification, Income verification, Work history |
| Argyle   | Employment Fallback | Employment verification, Income verification, Work history |
| Plaid    | Banking Primary | Bank account connection, Transaction analysis, Balance verification |
| Flinks   | Banking Fallback | Bank account connection, Transaction analysis, Balance verification |

## Fallback Behavior
1. For each step, Cove attempts verification with the first provider in the array
2. If the primary provider fails (e.g., service unavailable or verification failed):
   - Cove automatically tries the next provider in the array
   - This continues until either:
     - A successful verification is achieved
     - All providers have been attempted
3. If all providers fail, the step is marked as failed

## Notes
- The order of providers in the array determines the fallback sequence
- Steps with empty provider arrays (`[]`) are handled internally by Cove's verification system
- Provider availability may vary by region and verification type
