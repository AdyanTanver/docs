# **Custom Screening Flows**

## **Introduction**

Flows allow you to create custom screening processes tailored to your specific needs. Instead of using predefined checks, you can define a sequence of steps and reuse them across multiple screenings.

This guide walks you through:

1. **Listing available steps**

2. **Creating a flow**

3. **Using a flow to send a screening request**

## **Step 1: List Available Steps**

Before creating a flow, you need to know what steps are available.

### **Endpoint**

```md
GET /v1/flows/steps/list
```

### **Description**

Retrieves all available steps that can be used in a flow.

### **Headers**

* `Authorization`: `<API Key>`

* `Accept`: `application/json`

### **Example Request**

```sh
curl -X GET https://sandbox-api.getcove.co/v1/flows/steps/list \
-H "Authorization: your-access-token" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

* **Success (200):**
```json
  {
    "steps": [
      { "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011", "name": "Identity Verification" },
      { "id": "607f1f77bcf86cd799439012", "name": "Credit Check" },
      { "id": "707f1f77bcf86cd799439013", "name": "Bank Check" }
    ]
  }
  ```

## **Step 2: Create a Flow**

Once you have the list of steps, you can create a new flow by defining its name and sequence of steps.

### **Endpoint**

```md
POST /v1/flows
```

### **Description**

Creates a custom screening flow with the selected steps.

### **Headers**

* `Authorization`: `<API Key>`

* `Content-Type`: `application/json`

* `Accept`: `application/json`

### **Request Body**

```json
{
  "flow": {
    "name": "Custom Screening Flow 5",
    "steps": [
      { "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011" },
      { "id": "707f1f77bcf86cd799439013", "options": { "skippable": true } },
      { "id": "607f1f77bcf86cd799439012" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Example Request**

```sh
curl -X POST https://sandbox-api.getcove.co/v1/flows \
-H "Authorization: your-access-token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "name": "Custom Screening Flow",
    "steps": [
      { "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011" },
      { "id": "707f1f77bcf86cd799439013", "options": { "skippable": true } },
      { "id": "607f1f77bcf86cd799439012" }
    ]
  }
}'
```

* **Success (200):**
```json
  {
    "flowId": "107f1f77bcf86cd799439011"
  }
  ```

## **Step 3: Send a Screening Using a Flow**

Now that you have a `flowId`, you can use it to send a screening request to an applicant.

### **Endpoint**

```md
POST /v2/screening/send
```

### **Description**

Sends a screening request using a predefined flow.

### **Headers**

* `Authorization`: `<API Key>`

* `Content-Type`: `application/json`

* `Accept`: `application/json`

### **Request Body**

```json
{
  "flowId": "107f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "email": "applicant@example.com",
  "phone": "+14160001111",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "payer": "PAYER_SELF"
}
```

### **Example Request**

```sh
curl -X POST https://sandbox-api.getcove.co/v2/screening/send \
-H "Authorization: your-access-token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flowId": "107f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "email": "applicant@example.com",
  "phone": "+14160001111",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "payer": "PAYER_SELF"
}'
```

* **Success (200):**
```json
  {
    "userId": "007f1f77bcf86cd799439010",
    "message": "Screening link sent successfully."
  }
  ```

## **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you can create a fully customized screening process that fits your specific requirements. This enables more flexible, reusable, and automated screenings.
